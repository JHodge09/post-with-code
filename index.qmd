This is a post with Random Forest Code

OFP_data\<-MP2_data_option2

```{r, echo=TRUE}

library(dplyr)
library(rpart)
library(ipred)
library(caret)
library(ggplot2)
library(randomForest)
library(knitr)
library(readr)

MP2_data_option2 <- read_csv("C:/Users/hodge/OneDrive/Desktop/2nd Class Using R/MP2_data_option2.csv")

OFP_data<-MP2_data_option2

Hi,

My name is Jeremy Hodge. I'm a data analyst that has been in the healthcare industry for almost a decade. In my line of work I specialize in Excel, SQL, and data cleansing.

For the topic of the blog, I would like to discuss Random Forest. This method is valuable due to high accuracy, mitigating over fitting, detecting outliers, and handling missing values. Below, I provided a code utilizing Random Forest.

```{r}

OFP_data$adldiff <- factor(OFP_data$adldiff)
OFP_data$black <- factor(OFP_data$black)
OFP_data$sex <- factor(OFP_data$sex)
OFP_data$maried <- factor(OFP_data$maried)
OFP_data$employed <- factor(OFP_data$employed)
OFP_data$privins <- factor(OFP_data$privins)
OFP_data$medicaid <- factor(OFP_data$medicaid)
OFP_data$region <- factor(OFP_data$region)
OFP_data$hlth <- factor(OFP_data$hlth)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(5410)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
index <- sample(1:nrow(OFP_data), nrow(OFP_data)*0.7)
OFP_train <- OFP_data[index, ]
OFP_test <- OFP_data[-index, ]


print(table(OFP_train$hlth))

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(22222)

# Train the random forest model with default parameters
rf_default <- randomForest(hlth ~ ., data = OFP_train)

# Print the summary of the model
print(rf_default)
```

In conclusion, Random Forest is useful for being able to create accurate predictions, reducing overfitting, and dealing with missing data, this makes Random Forest a valuable tool in machine learning.
